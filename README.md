* 2. `app.py`
* 3. `requirements.txt`

## For running the analysis in designated environment
* clone repo locally
* run `transform.py`for transforming data and using transformed data for example dashboard
* create an environment with the contents of the requirements.txt file (if you are using conda: install pip first (e.g. via `conda install pip` and then `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
* run `streamlit run app.py` for seeing an example dashboard for the analysis.

## For running the app in a docker container
* clone repo locally
* build image with
`docker build -t streamlitchurnapp:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .`
* run image with
`docker run -p 8501:8501 streamlitchurnapp:latest`
